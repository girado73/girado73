## Hi there 👋

I am a Programmer from Germany/Saxony. <br>
📅 I am trying to learn new things daily and work on my open-source projects to improve myself. <br>
🖥️ Programming languages I am interested in:
- Python
- Rust
- C / C++
- Functional Progamming Languages(Haskell, Elixir)

💻 When Coding I use my Mac or my Arch Linux Laptop. I am also trying to purely code everything in Neovim.

🔭 I’m currently working on small projects for the University <br>
🌱 I’m currently learning Rust and AI-Development <br>
👯 I’m looking to collaborate on an open source project in the future <br>
📫 How to reach me:
1. Discord derpassatfahrer
2. GitHub
3. Email

😄 Pronouns: he/him <br>
⚡ Fun fact: Most of the time when coding a project, I try to rewrite the logic in Haskell and make fun of how few lines it takes me
